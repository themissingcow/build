# packages, we use yum-versionlock to keep them pinned. We track the list of
# image packages here, then compare after our install steps to see what was
# added, and only lock those. This saves us storing redundant entires for
# packages installed in the base image.

# To unlock versions, just make sure yum-versionlock.list is empty in the repo

# We can't use ENTRYPOINT as it's not allowed on Azure. The ENV/BASH_ENV vars
# are sourced whenever a non-interactive sh/bash session is started.
# PROMPT_COMMAND is evaluated before a prompt is displayed in interactive
# sessions. Using all of these ensures that our scl_enable script
#Â is always run, regardless of which shell is being used. The scl_enable script
# simply unsets these (as its work will be done) and sources the appropriate
# scl environment. Thanks to:
