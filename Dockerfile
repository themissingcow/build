# We can't use ENTRYPOINT as it's not allowed on Azure. The ENV/BASH_ENV vars
# are sourced whenever a non-interactive sh/bash session is started.
# PROMPT_COMMAND is evaluated before a prompt is displayed in interactive
# sessions. Using all of these ensures that our scl_enable script
#Â is always run, regardless of which shell is being used. The scl_enable script
# simply unsets these (as its work will be done) and sources the appropriate
# scl environment. Thanks to:
